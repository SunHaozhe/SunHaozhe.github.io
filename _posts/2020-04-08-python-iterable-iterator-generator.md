Iterable: 

* It is an object that contains a countable number of values. 
* It is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.
* It is an object that has an `__iter__()` method or defines a `__getitem__()` method. 
* It generates an Iterator when passed to `iter()` method.


Iterator:

* It is an object which is used to iterate over an iterable object. 
* it must implement `__iter__()`method and `__next__()`method. 
* `__next__()` method returns the next item of the object.
* It is an object with state that remembers where it is during iteration. 
* It is self-iterable (meaning that it has an `__iter__` method that returns `self``. 



Every iterator is also an iterable, but not every iterable is an iterator. For example, a list is iterable but it is not an iterator. 

$$\text{iterator} \subsetneq \text{iterable}$$

When a `for` loop is executed, the `for` statement calls `iter()` on the iterable object. If successful, the `iter()` call will return an iterator object that defines the `__next__()` method, which accesses elements of the object one at a time. The `__next__()` method will raise a `StopIteration` exception, if there are no further elements available. The `for` loop will terminate as soon as it catches a `StopIteration` exception. 

```python
list_ = ["A", "B", "C"] 
iterator_obj = iter(list_) 
print(next(iterator_obj)) # A
print(next(iterator_obj)) # B
print(next(iterator_obj)) # C
```
