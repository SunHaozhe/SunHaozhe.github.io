One problem of terminology: logit

In statistics, the logit (/ˈloʊdʒɪt/ LOH-jit) function or the log-odds is the logarithm of the odds p/(1 − p) 
where p is the probability.[1]. It is a type of function that creates a map of probability values from [0,1] to 
$[-\infty, +\infty]$. It is the inverse of the standard logistic function (sigmoid).

In deep learning, the term logits layer is popularly used for the last neuron layer of neural networks used for 
classification tasks, which produce raw prediction values as real numbers ranging from $[-\infty, +\infty]$.

When one talks about deep learning for classification tasks, the output values of the next to last layer 
(the layer before the final softmax activation) are called logits.
