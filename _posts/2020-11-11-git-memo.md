# Stage, commit, push

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add


```zsh
git add -A # stages all changes
git commit -m "xxx"
git push
```

We can undo `git add` before `commit`. The following will remove `file.txt` from the current index (the "about to be committed" list) without changing anything else

```zsh
git reset file.txt
```

To unstage all changes

```zsh
git reset
```

# Branching and merging

Lists existing branches, the current branch will be highlighted in green and marked with an asterisk

```zsh
git branch

# lists remote-tracking branches
git branch -r

# lists both local and remote branches
git branch -a
```

Creates a new branch and switch to it at the same time

```zsh
git branch new_branch_name
git checkout new_branch_name
```

This is equivalent to 

```zsh
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

Switches (back) to the `master` branch (Itâ€™s best to have a clean working state when one switches branches)

```zsh
git checkout master 
```

Makes some changes in a new branch, then merges that branch back into the `master` branch

```zsh
# creates a new branch to work on
git checkout -b new_branch_name

...
git commit -m "blablabla"

# merges the new branch 
git checkout master
git merge new_branch_name 

# deletes the new branch, because one no longer 
# needs it, the master branch points to the same place
git branch -d new_branch_name
```

If a branch `branch_name_1` is not fully merged, `git branch -d branch_name_1` raises an error which prevents this deletion. If we are sure we want to delete it, do the following 

```zsh
git branch -d --force branch_name_1

# -D is the shortcut for --delete --force
git branch -D branch_name_1
```

Shows changes 

```zsh
# between branches
git diff master new_branch_name

# between commits 
git diff 8496675381 93788e32b
```


# Checking states 

Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area

```zsh
git status 
```

Shows commit logs

```zsh
# shows the current HEAD and its ancestry 
git log 
```

Reference logs. `git reflog` doesn't traverse HEAD's ancestry at all. The reflog is an ordered list of the commits that HEAD has pointed to: it's undo history for your repo. The reflog isn't part of the repo itself (it's stored separately to the commits themselves) and isn't included in pushes, fetches or clones; it's purely local.

```zsh
git reflog
```


# Config 

```zsh
git config --list
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```
