# Stage, commit, push

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add


```zsh
git add -A # stages all changes
git commit -m "xxx"
git push
```

# Branching and merging

Creates a new branch and switch to it at the same time

```zsh
git branch new_branch_name
git checkout new_branch_name
```

This is equivalent to 

```zsh
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

Switches (back) to the `master` branch (Itâ€™s best to have a clean working state when one switches branches)

```zsh
git checkout master 
```

Makes some changes in a new branch, then merges that branch back into the `master` branch

```zsh
# creates a new branch to work on
git checkout -b new_branch_name

...
git commit -m "blablabla"

# merges the new branch 
git checkout master
git merge new_branch_name 

# deletes the new branch, because one no longer 
# needs it, the master branch points to the same place
git branch -d new_branch_name
```

# Config 

```zsh
git config --list
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

# Checking states 

Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area

```zsh
git status 
```
