# Vim modes

When you launch the Vim editor, you're in normal mode. 

To type a text, you need to enter the insert mode by pressing the `i` key. This mode allows you to insert and delete characters in the same way you do in a regular text editor.

To go back to the normal mode from any other mode, just press the `Esc` key. 

# Open a file in Vim / Vi

```bash
vim file.text
```

# Save the file without exiting Vim / Vi 

* Press `Esc`
* Type `:w`
* Press `Enter`


To save the file under a different name, type `:w new_filename` and hit `Enter`.

# Save a file and quit Vim / Vi

`:wq`

# Quit Vim / Vi without saving the file

`:q!`
