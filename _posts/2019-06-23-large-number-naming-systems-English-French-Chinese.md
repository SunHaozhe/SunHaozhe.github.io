| English     | French   | Chinese | Scientific notation |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| million     | million  | 百万    | 10^6                |
| billion     | milliard | 十亿    | 10^9                |
| trillion    | billion  | 万亿    | 10^12               |
| quadrillion | -        | -       | 10^15               |

The long scales (长级差制) and short scales (短级差制) are two of several large-number naming systems for integer powers 
of ten that use the same words with different meanings. The long scale is based on powers of 
one million, whereas the short scale is based on powers of one thousand.


* Most English-language countries and regions use the short scale with 10^9 being billion. 

* The traditional long scale is used by most Continental European countries and by most other 
countries whose languages derive from Continental Europe (with the notable exceptions of Albania, 
Greece, Romania,[57] and Brazil). These countries use a word similar to billion to mean 1012. Some 
use a word similar to milliard to mean 109, while others use a word or phrase equivalent to thousand 
millions.
